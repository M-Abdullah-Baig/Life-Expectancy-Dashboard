# Life-Expectancy-Dashboard

This Life Expectancy Dashboard provides a detailed analysis of global life expectancy trends and the key factors influencing them, such as GDP, BMI, healthcare expenditure, and adult mortality. The first page offers a high-level summary of averages, including population, GDP, BMI, adult mortality, and healthcare expenditure, alongside interactive filters for country and year selection. Key visualizations like a gauge chart display average life expectancy (e.g., 69.22 years), while a heatmap highlights regional disparities, with developed regions such as Europe and North America showing higher life expectancy compared to developing regions like Africa. Temporal trends are visualized in a line chart, showing consistent improvements in life expectancy globally.

The dashboard also highlights notable metrics: Luxembourg (2014) had the highest GDP ($119,172.74), while Nauru (2013) recorded the highest BMI (87.30). Belgium and Finland (2014) led in life expectancy (89 years), and India (2014) had the largest population (1.29 billion). The USA (2011) spent the most on health (17.60%), while Zimbabwe (2004) had the highest adult mortality (723). Disease impacts are emphasized, such as measles in Nigeria (2000), HIV/AIDS in Swaziland (2003), and Hepatitis B/Polio in Albania (2004-2010), providing critical insights into global health disparities and challenges.
